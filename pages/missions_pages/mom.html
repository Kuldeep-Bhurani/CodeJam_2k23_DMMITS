          Mangalyaan, also known as the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), was launched aboard the Polar Satellite Launch
          Vehicle
          (PSLV) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on November 5, 2013. PSLV is one of the most reliable launch
          vehicles
          of ISRO and has been used for various successful missions, including Chandrayaan and other satellite
          deployments.
          It played a crucial role in placing Mangalyaan on its trajectory to Mars.

        Mangalyaan, India's Mars Orbiter Mission, was launched with the objective of exploring Mars' surface,
        morphology,
        and mineralogy. The mission aimed to demonstrate India's space technology capabilities by reaching the Martian
        orbit. On September 24, 2014, Mangalyaan successfully entered Mars' orbit, making India the first Asian country
        to
        reach the Martian orbit and the fourth space agency in the world to do so.

      <h2>Mission Achievements</h2>
      <p>
        Mangalyaan's successful entry into Mars' orbit marked a significant milestone for India's space exploration
        program.
        The mission achieved its primary objectives of capturing images of Mars, studying the Martian surface, and
        conducting scientific experiments. It provided valuable data on Martian atmosphere, methane presence, and other
        characteristics. Mangalyaan's success garnered international acclaim and strengthened India's position in space
        research and technology.
