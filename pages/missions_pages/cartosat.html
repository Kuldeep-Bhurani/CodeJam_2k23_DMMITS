          Cartosat missions are launched aboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from the Satish Dhawan Space
          Centre.
          PSLV is one of ISRO's most reliable launch vehicles, known for its successful track record in deploying
          various
          satellites, including Earth observation satellites like Cartosat, into their intended orbits.

      <p>
        Cartosat series of satellites are dedicated Earth observation satellites developed by the Indian Space Research
        Organisation (ISRO). The primary objective of Cartosat missions is to provide high-resolution and detailed
        imagery
        of
        the Earth's surface, which is used for cartographic applications, urban planning, rural development, and
        infrastructure development projects.

      <h2>Mission Contributions</h2>
      <p>
        Cartosat satellites play a crucial role in supporting various developmental and planning activities in India and
        other
        countries. The high-resolution imagery provided by these satellites aids in resource management, urban planning,
        environmental monitoring, disaster management, and land-use mapping. The Cartosat series has significantly
        contributed
        to the field of cartography and geospatial applications, making it an essential asset for the nation's
        development
        and
        progress.
