          Astrosat was launched aboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.
          PSLV
          is
          a reliable launch vehicle used by ISRO for a variety of missions, including placing Astrosat into its desired
          orbit
          for observing stars and galaxies in space.

        Astrosat is India's first dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory. Launched on September 28, 2015, by ISRO,
        the
        satellite is designed to observe stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects in various wavelengths like
        X-rays,
        ultraviolet, and visible light. The mission has been instrumental in contributing to the study of the universe
        and
        expanding our knowledge of cosmic objects and phenomena.
