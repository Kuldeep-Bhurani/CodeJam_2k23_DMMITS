          Chandrayaan-3 is expected to be launched aboard the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk
          III),
          commonly known as LVM3. GSLV Mk III is ISRO's heavy-lift launch vehicle and has proven its capability with
          successful missions in the past. It is designed to carry heavy payloads to various orbits, including lunar
          transfer
          trajectory, and play a crucial role in India's space exploration endeavors.
