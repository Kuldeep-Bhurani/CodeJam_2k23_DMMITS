          Aditya L1 Solar Mission is expected to be launched aboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from the
          Satish
          Dhawan Space Centre. PSLV is one of ISRO's reliable launch vehicles, and it has been utilized for various
          successful
          missions, including Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan. It will play a crucial role in placing Aditya L1 on its
          trajectory
          towards the Sun.

      <p>
        Aditya L1 Solar Mission, named after the Sun god Aditya, is a solar observation mission by the Indian Space
        Research
        Organisation (ISRO). The mission aims to study the Sun's outermost layer, the corona, and the chromosphere,
        along
        with
        the solar magnetic field. By studying the Sun, Aditya L1 will help in understanding the solar processes that
        impact
        space weather and influence our planet.

      <h2>Scientists and Team</h2>
      <p>
        The Aditya L1 Solar Mission involves a dedicated team of scientists, engineers, and researchers from ISRO and
        various
        research institutions. Led by experienced mission directors, this team is committed to the success of the
        mission
        and
        advancing our knowledge of the Sun's behavior and its effects on our solar system.

      <h2>Expected Mission Outcomes</h2>
      <p>
        Aditya L1's observations will provide crucial data to enhance our understanding of the Sun and its behavior. The
        mission aims to study solar phenomena like solar flares, solar wind, and magnetic fields. By studying these
        solar
        processes, scientists hope to gain insights into space weather and its impact on Earth and its technological
        systems.
        The mission is set to contribute significantly to the field of heliophysics and further our knowledge of our
        closest
        celestial neighbor, the Sun.
