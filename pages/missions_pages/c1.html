          Chandrayaan-1 was launched aboard a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C11) from the Satish Dhawan Space
          Centre.
          PSLV-C11 was a four-stage launch vehicle and successfully placed Chandrayaan-1 into the lunar transfer
          trajectory.
          The launch vehicle provided the necessary thrust to carry the spacecraft towards the Moon's orbit.

      <p>
        Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar probe, launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on
        October
        22, 2008. The mission aimed to study the Moon's surface and discover evidence of water molecules.

      <p>
        The Chandrayaan-1 mission involved a team of dedicated scientists, engineers, and researchers from ISRO and
        various
        institutions. Dr. Mylswamy Annadurai served as the Project Director and was instrumental in the success of the
        mission.

      <h2>Mission Failure</h2>
      <p>
        Chandrayaan-1 successfully completed its mission objectives and provided valuable data about the Moon. However,
        on
        August 29, 2009, communication with the spacecraft was lost, and the mission was prematurely terminated after
        operating for more than 300 days. Despite the early failure, Chandrayaan-1 achieved several significant
        milestones
        and laid the foundation for India's future lunar exploration missions.
