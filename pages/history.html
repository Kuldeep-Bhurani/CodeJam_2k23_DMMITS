                <h1>THE START</h1>
                <p>
                    ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) was founded by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, an eminent Indian
                    scientist
                    and visionary, on August 15, 1969. Dr. Sarabhai was a pioneer in space research and played a crucial
                    role in
                    India's space program.

                    The establishment of ISRO was driven by India's need for space research and satellite technology for
                    the
                    country's socio-economic development. Dr. Sarabhai firmly believed that space technology could
                    address various
                    challenges faced by India, such as communication, weather forecasting, resource management, and
                    disaster
                    monitoring.

                    In the early stages, Dr. Sarabhai collaborated with a team of talented scientists, engineers, and
                    experts from
                    various fields. They worked collectively to lay the foundation of India's space program and build
                    the necessary
                    infrastructure to conduct space research and satellite launches.

                    ISRO's first indigenous rocket, SLV-3 (Satellite Launch Vehicle-3), was developed under the
                    leadership of Dr.
                    APJ Abdul Kalam, who later became the President of India. SLV-3's development was a significant
                    milestone for
                    India, as it marked the country's entry into space launch capabilities.

                    The SLV-3 was a four-stage rocket designed to carry a payload of about 40 kilograms into low Earth
                    orbit. On
                    July 18, 1980, India achieved its first successful satellite launch using the SLV-3, placing the
                    Rohini satellite
                    into orbit. This achievement was a testament to the dedication and ingenuity of the Indian
                    scientists and
                    engineers who worked tirelessly to make India a space-faring nation.

                    Since then, ISRO has continued to make remarkable progress, undertaking numerous successful
                    missions, including
                    lunar and interplanetary explorations, and becoming a globally respected space agency known for its
                    cost-effective
                    and reliable space missions. Driven by its motto of "Space technology for national development,"
                    ISRO continues
                    to play a pivotal role in shaping India's space endeavors and contributing to the advancement of
                    science and
                    technology on a global scale.

                <p>
                    ISRO continues to explore new horizons and push the boundaries of space research, This time under Dr
                    APJ Abdul Kalam. With its growing expertise
                    and cutting-edge technology, ISRO has ambitious plans for the future.

                    Some of the key areas that ISRO aims to focus on in the near future include:

                    - Expanding satellite communication services to remote areas, enabling better connectivity and
                    digital access
                    - Advancing space research in the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, and planetary science
                    - Launching more interplanetary missions to explore other celestial bodies in our solar system
                    - Developing indigenous technologies for human spaceflight and conducting manned missions
                    - Enhancing earth observation capabilities for environmental monitoring and disaster management
                    - Exploring the potential of space-based solar power generation
                    - Collaborating with international space agencies and organizations to foster global cooperation in
                    space exploration

                    Through its endeavors, ISRO aims to leverage space technology for the benefit of humanity and
                    contribute to
                    India's progress in various sectors, including agriculture, healthcare, and education. As the
                    organization
                    continues to evolve, it remains committed to its vision of making space accessible, affordable, and
                    beneficial
                    for all.
